<!-- Plugin description -->
Remember your projects by color! Colorize the title bar to differentiate your open projects.

Working on multiple projects simultaneously with intellij products can be difficult, 
since they all look the same on the taskbar, this plugin solves that by giving the user the option
to colorize each project's title bar, which is visible from the taskbar windows menu.
